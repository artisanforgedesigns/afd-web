## Getting Started

### First Run

> **üí° Quick Start Tip:** The entire setup process typically takes 5-10 minutes. Make sure you have your WiFi password ready!

2. **Connect to Setup Network**: Connect to the PiLock wifi network and wait for the captive portal page to pop up. This may take up to 120 seconds but you can also navigate to the page directly:
   ```
   http://192.168.4.1
   ```

3. **Configure WiFi**: Select your wifi network (must be 2.4 GHz), enter your password, click "Connect" and wait for the board to reboot

4. **Access Your Device**: Reconnect to your home network and navigate to:
   ```
   http://pilock.local:5001
   ```
   > **‚ÑπÔ∏è Note:** If this doesn't work, check your router's device list to find the IP address

5. **You're Done!** Your PiLock will automatically connect to your network from now on

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Usage

**Q: The scene won't start - what's wrong?**
A: Check that:
- At least one device is enabled (checkbox checked)
- Your API credentials are correct in Settings
- Device IDs/share codes are valid
- You clicked "SAVE CONFIGURATION" after making changes

**Q: Can I run multiple scenes at once?**
A: No, only one scene can run at a time. Stop the current scene before starting a new one.

**Q: What happens if I lose internet connection during a scene?**
A: The scene will continue running, but device commands may fail. Check the status feed for error messages.

### Device Configuration

**Q: My PiShock device isn't responding**
A: Verify:
- Share code is correct (not the device ID)
- API key is valid
- Username matches your PiShock account
- Device is online and charged

**Q: Switchbot commands aren't working**
A: Check:
- Token and secret are correct
- Device ID is the actual device ID (not device name)
- Device is within Bluetooth/Hub range
- SwitchBot app can control the device

**Q: My smart lock isn't responding to webhook calls**
A: Ensure:
- Webhook URLs start with `https://us-apia.coolkit.cc/v2/`
- Webhooks are properly configured in eWeLink app
- Lock device is online and responsive in eWeLink app

### Scene Behavior

**Q: Why do my devices trigger at different times than expected?**
A: PiLock uses the interval as "time between triggers", not "triggers per minute". A 30-second interval means the device activates every 30 seconds.

**Q: What does "random" mean for intervals and intensity?**
A: Random values are calculated for each trigger. For example, `10-30` intensity will choose a random number between 10 and 30 for each activation.

**Q: Can I have unlimited device triggers?**
A: Yes, leave the "Repeat" field empty for unlimited triggers during the scene duration.

**Q: The countdown shows wrong time**
A: During the delay phase, countdown shows seconds remaining in delay. During scene execution, it shows time remaining in the scene.


### Updates

**Q: How do I check for updates?**
A: On the Settings page, click "üîç CHECK FOR UPDATES". If an update is available, you'll see UPDATE and CANCEL buttons.

**Q: Will updating overwrite my settings?**
A: No, updates only change the application code. Your settings and scene configurations in the `data/` folder are preserved.
